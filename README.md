# Recipeat

Recipeat is a personal project I created during a web development course to put into practice what I was learning. Eventhough, Recipeat was created for practice it also aims to simplify a personal daily task in where I like to calculate and regulate my daily calorie and macro nutrient consumption. Recipeat, therefore allows users to share recipes that dynamically display calories and values based on a user managed ingredient database. A deployed and actively used version can be found here:
